        <h2>Chapter One: Understanding Nordic and Scandinavian</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the Nordic Countries, there are two entities; The Scandinavian Countries, and the Other Nordic Countries.
            All of the Nordic Countries together are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>All five countries are Nordic, but three of them are Scandinavian while the other two aren't; The
            Scandinavian countries are Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and the other Nordic countries are Finland and
            Iceland. In order to understand which Nordic countries are Scandinavian and which ones are not, we need to
            look at their history and georgraphy.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The term "Nordic" basically means countries that are Scandinavian, and countries that were colonized,
            controlled, or influenced by the
            Scandinavian countries. </p>

        <h3>Map of The Nordic Countries</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The countries that are Scandinavian have the following traits; they are located along the Scandinavian
            Peninsula and Denmark, their languages are descended from Old Norse and Germanic languages, the ancient
            societies of
            Vikings came from their lands, and the were responsible for colonization and influence of the other two
            Nordic Countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The Scandinavian countries are as followed: </p>
        </br>
        <p>Sweden is the largest country by population and land area, and It
            takes up the eastern half of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Its capital is Stockholm, and it is the most
            powerful and most influential Scandinavian and Nordic Country.</p>
        </br>
        <p> Denmark is the smallest in land area but second in populaton, and it takes up the lands of Jutland and
            neighboring islands, all south of the main Scandinavian Peninsula (even though Denmark is not on the
            Scandinavian Peninsula and it is attacked to
            mainlaind Europe via Jutland, it is still Scandinavian as the Vikings and Norse cultures came from there).
            Its capital is Copenhagen, and it is the second most influential Scandinavian and Nordic Country.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Norway is the second largest in land area but smallest in population. It takes up the western half pf the
            Scandinavian Peninsula. It was controlled by both Denmark and Sweden throughout its history, and it has
            only been independant since 1905. Its capital is Oslo, and it holds a place as a country that was
            controlled by the other Scandinavian countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>All three countries have history spanning back to the Viking Age, when their people, called Vikings (also
            know as Norsemen) led
            expeditions of war, raids, trade, and exchange to other places in Europe and other continents.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The three countries have a long history of conflict, exchange, and infleunce.</p>
        </br>
        <p>One example of their is history (as mentioned in the previous paragraph about Norway): For a long time,
            Norway was
            under the control of Denmark until 1814, when Denmark was defeated in the Naopleonic Wars and Norway was
            ceded to Sweden, which ruled Norway until they split up in 1905.</p>

        <p>One other trait that the three
            Scandinavian countries have is that they are all Constitutional Monarchies.</p>
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="main-page-first-image">
        <img class="map-2" src="nordic-images/Scandinavia.webp">
    </div>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The other two Nordic countries, which complete the puzzle of the five Nordic countries along with the
            Scandinavian countries, are not Scandinavian, but were colonized by and influenced by the Scandinavian
            countries. Finland and Iceland, the other two Nordic countries, were colonized and were part of Sweden and
            Denmark for much of their history.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Finland, which borders Sweden to the East, was part of Sweden until 1809 when it was taken by Russia, and it
            remained a part of Russia until 1917 when it gained independence from the newly formed Soviet Union. Because
            Finland was part of Sweden for so long, and it had a lot of cultural ties and influence from Sweden,
            Finland earned a spot as a Nordic country.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Iceland is an Island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was a colony of Denmark for many centuries, with
            influence going back to the Viking Age. Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1944 after being occupied
            by the United States when Denmark was invaded and conquered by Germany in World War II.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The other two Nordic countries have these differences with the Scandinavian countries: they were not
            home of the Vikings/Norsemen, they have theyre own distinct languages and cultures with Scandinavian
            influence, they are not on The Scandinavian Peninusla or Denmark, and they are run by Republics instead of
            Constitutional Monarchies.</p>
        </br>
        <p>There are also a few other areas of the Nordic countries that are semi-independent but under the authority of
            Denmark or Norway.</p>
        </br>
        <p>One example is a places that is known as Greenland, and it is the world's largest island. It is in North
            America,
            seperated from Canada by seas to the West, and west of Iceland by a number of miles of ocean.
            Greenland is a huge (Over 800,000 square miles) but very sparsley populated place, with less
            than sixty-thousand residents. Like Iceland, it was colonized by Vikings, but it never gained independence
            from Denmark, and it is still controlled by Denmark to this day. Also, like Iceland, Greenland was occupied
            by the United States during World War II, but it was returned to Denmark after the war, whereas Iceland
            gained independence.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>The other two places that are part of the Nordic countries are Svalbard and Jan Mayen.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Svalbard is an island area way up above the Arctic circle, further North than Iceland and the populated areas
            of Greenland. It is controlled by Norway and is the Northernmost
            inhabited place on earth, with a very small and very sparse population of about two-and-a-half-thousand
            residents.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Jan Mayen is another Island that is controlled by Norway. However, it is not populated, and is really just a
            small island with geographic monument that people can go visit, but cannot live on.</p>

        <h2>Chapter Two: Viking Age</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>from the 700s to the 1000s, The Scandinavian Countries were made up of a peoples called Vikings.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The Vikings, who were called Norsemen at the time, came from Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. The were warfarers,
            merchants, traiders, raiders, and explorers.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Each country had their own nationality of Vikings, although they were all the same Scandinavian peoples who
            spoke Old Norse and used the same religion and political system, as well as the same cultural aspects.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The key difference between the nationalities of Vikings was the areas of the world that each nationality went
            to. Danish and Norwegian Vikings mainly went west, making their way to England, France, Ireland, and even
            Canada. Swedish Vikings mainly went east, making their way to places like Ukraine, Russia, Finland, The
            Baltics, and even Western Asia.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Vikings did things like raid, terrorize, and destroy the areas they visited.</p>
        </br>

        <p>Danish Vikings went to places like England, France, and Germany, where they raided, plundered, and traded
            with the places they visited.</p>

        <p>Swedish Vikings went east, across the Baltic Sea. They helped create the Rus State, which
            would become the Modern States of Ukraine and Russia. They also attempted to conquer the Byzantine Empire,
            but were unsuccesful. Swedish Vikings also established influence in Finland, which led to Finland becoming
            part of the first Swedish State.</p>

        <p> Norwegian Vikings went west, across the Atlantic Ocean to Iceland. Norwegian Vikings born in Iceland
            eventuallly went further west across the ocean to Canada and Greenland, becoming the first Europeans to
            reach the Americas.</p>

    <div class="chapter-title">
        <h2>Chapter Three: Kalmar Union, and Until Now.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After the End of the Viking Age in the 1060s, The Nordic Countries began to unfold. In 1397, all of the
            Nordic countries unified into a single state called thee Kalmar Union, which was under the control of
            the Danish. The Kalmar Union existed as a unified Nordic empire until 1523, when Sweden broke away due
            to resentment of the abusive rule of the Danish. The newly independant Sweden was mad eup of the modern
            lands of Sweden and of Modern Finland.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>The newly independant Sweden, and the new Kingdom of Denmark-Norway (which was renamed after Sweden left 
            the Kalmar Union), became bitter rivals, and fought many wars over the next three hundred years.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Over the course of the second half of the second millenium, Sweden became a great power, conquering lands
            around Eastern and Northern Europe. The peak was in 1658, when Sweden's Empire expanded from the Western
            Coast of Norway all the way into the mainland of Modern Russia and into Modern Poland. However, over the
            course of the next one- hundred-and-fifty years, Sweden began its decline. In 1709, Sweden lost to Russia
            in Ukraine, and the Swedish King was exiled. By 1809, Sweden was diminished, when it had just lost
            Finland to Russia, and couldn't fight anymore. Sweden did gain Norway from Denmark in 1814 after the
            defeat of France and Denmark in the Napoleonic Wars, but it didn't return its status as a great power.
            Sweden has remained a small-middle power since the 1800s.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Denmark also was an important power in Europe in the second millenium, though it wasnt as powerful as Sweden
            was at the time. Denmark and Sweden fought many wars due to their rivalry. Denmark controlled Norway during
            the time between 1523 and 1814. Norway was heavily influended by Denmark, and the modern Norwegian Bokmål
            language was developed out of Danish. Denmark controlled Norway until 1814, when Denmark was defeated in
            thevNapoleionic Wars. Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden and Norway was forced to accept annexation by Sweden.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>From 1814 to 1905, the union of Sweden-Norway Existed. Hard times in the 1800s led to many from both Sweden
            and Norway to emigrate, most of whom moved to the United States of America.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Denmark still controlled Greenland and Iceland after the Napoleonic Wars. Iceland wouldnt gain independence
            until 1944.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Sweden and Norway split up in 1905, when Norway had grown very resentful of Swedish rule. The most
            incredible fact about the end of the Sweden-Norway Union was that the Swedish people supported Norway's
            independence, and that the Swedish people refused to support or work for their government in keeping Norway
            in the Union.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>After successfully gaining independence from Sweden, Norway chose a Prince of Denmark to become King of
            Norway, and the royal family still reigns over Norway to this day.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Finland remained under Russian control until 1917, and after it gained independence, it aligned with the
            Nordics. It adopted a Republican government and kept its Finnish Language, which is not Scandinavian.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Since 1917, all of the Nordic countries have been in the arrangement of independent nations they are
            today (barring that Denmark and Norway were occupied by Germany from in World War II, and Finland was
            invaded by and lost some lands to Russia in World War II).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Since the early 20th century, the Scandinavian and Nordic countries made strides to make themselves
            wealthy. They all invested in market economies, capitalism, manufacturing, technology, and trade, and
            it resulted in incredible amounts of success in all of the countries. Nowadays, All five of the Nordics
            are developed and wealthy economies, a contrast to the poor and unstable nation they used to be in the
            1800s. Norway is the wealthiest per capita of all of the Nordic Countries, with a high wealth amount.

        <h2>Chapter Four: Nordic Immigration to the United States</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Between 1850 and 1920, many Scandinavian and Nordic immigrants came to the USA.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Sweden and Norway were the two countries where most of the immigrants came from, with 1.3 million and
            800,000 coming from each country respectively.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The immigrants (Especially the ones from Sweden and Norway) came to the USA due to political instability,
            poverty, religious tensions, and famine in the Scandinavian Countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Less immigrants came from Denmark, Finland, and Iceland because the situations in those countries were
            not as severe as they were in Sweden and Norway. Some Danish and Finnish immigrants did come to the US,
            but their numbers werealways overshadowed by the number of Swedes and Norwegians. Icelandics who left
            often ended up in Canada due to Canada's proximity to Iceland (there are more than 100,000 Icelandic-
            Canadians, which is a third of the population of Iceland itself).</p>
        </br>
        <p>Because Swedes and Norwegians made up the vast majority of Scandinavian immigrants and make up the
            overwhelming majority of Nordic/Scandinavian-Americans, we will only focus on the Swedish and Norwegian
            immigration.</p>
        </br>
        <p>There are about 4.3 million Swedish-Americans, and about 4.6 million Norwegian-Americans in this era.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Most Swedish and Norwegian immigrants settled in Midwestern States like Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota,
            and Illinois.</p>
        </br>
        <p>While not as many settled as in the Midwest, a good number of Swedish and Norwegian immigrants also settled
            in Western States like Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The rest of the USA has Nordic/Scandinavian heritage, but its the Midwest and West Coast that have the
            majority of Nordic/Scandinavian heritage, while the other parts of the country don't have as much.</p>

        <h2>Chapter Five: How They Influence America Today</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The influence of Scandinavian and Nordic Immigration still has an impact in the United States today.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The State that sees the most influence is Minnesota, which has more Scandinavian and Nordic Heritage than 
            any other State, with 1.6 million people having Nordic or Scandinavian heritage. Some examples of the
            Scandinavian/Nordic heritage in Minnesota include the Minnesota Vikings American Football team and Saint 
            Olaf College, which was established by Norwegian religious peoples. Minnesota's amount of 
            Scandinavian/Nordic heritage outnumbers the amount in every US State. </p>
        </br>
        <p>Another State with significant Scandinavian/Nordic Ancestry is Oregon. While there isn't as much
            Scandinavian/Nordic heritage in Oregon as there is in Minnesota, Oregon still has a large amount, with
            about ten percent of its population having Scandinavian/Nordic heritage. Swedes were at one point the 
            third largest immigrant group in Oregon, after Germans and Canadians. Norwegians also came to Oregon and 
            were a large group in the State in the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Other States that have a large amount of Scandinavian/Nordic ancestry include Washington, California, Idaho,
            Montana, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, North Dakota, Montana, Nevada, and Utah.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Norwegians are the largest group, with 4.6 million Americans having Norwegian ancestry. The other Nordic-
            American groups by population are Swedish (4.3 million), Danish (1.5 million), Finnish (600,000), and
            Icelandic (75,000).
