        <h2>Chapter One: Understanding Nordic and Scandinavian</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the Nordic Countries, there are two entities; The Scandinavian Countries, and the Other Nordic Countries.
            All of the Nordic Countries together are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>All five countries are Nordic, but three of them are Scandinavian while the other two aren't; The
            Scandinavian countries are Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and the other Nordic countries are Finland and
            Iceland. In order to understand which Nordic countries are Scandinavian and which ones are not, we need to
            look at their history and georgraphy.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The term "Nordic" basically means countries that are Scandinavian, and countries that were colonized,
            controlled, or influenced by the
            Scandinavian countries. </p>

        <h3>Map of Nordic Countries</h3>
    </div>
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The countries that are Scandinavian have the following traits; they are located along the Scandinavian
            Peninsula and Denmark, their languages are descended from Old Norse and Germanic languages, the ancient
            societies of
            Vikings came from their lands, and the were responsible for colonization and influence of the other two
            Nordic Countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The Scandinavian countries are as followed: </p>
        </br>
        <p>Sweden is the largest country by population and land area, and It
            takes up the eastern half of the Scandinavian Peninsula. Its capital is Stockholm, and it is the most
            powerful and most influential Scandinavian and Nordic Country.</p>
        </br>
        <p> Denmark is the smallest in land area but second in populaton, and it takes up the lands of Jutland and
            neighboring islands, all south of the main Scandinavian Peninsula (even though Denmark is not on the
            Scandinavian Peninsula and it is attacked to
            mainlaind Europe via Jutland, it is still Scandinavian as the Vikings and Norse cultures came from there).
            Its capital is Copenhagen, and it is the second most influential Scandinavian and Nordic Country.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Norway is the second largest in land area but smallest in population. It takes up the western half pf the
            Scandinavian Peninsula. It was controlled by both Denmark and Sweden throughout its history, and it has only
            been independant since 1905. Its capital is Oslo, and it holds a place as a country that was controlled by
            the other Scandinavian countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>All three countries have history spanning back to the Viking Age, when their people, called Vikings (also
            know as Norsemen) led
            expeditions of war, raids, trade, and exchange to other places in Europe and other continents.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The three countries have a long history of conflict, exchange, and infleunce.</p>
        </br>
        <p>One example of their is history (as mentioned in the previous paragraph about Norway): For a long time,
            Norway was
            under the control of Denmark until 1814, when Denmark was defeated in the Naopleonic Wars and Norway was
            ceded to Sweden, which ruled Norway until they split up in 1905.</p>

        <p>One other trait that the three
            Scandinavian countries have is that they are all Constitutional Monarchies.</p>

    </br>

    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The other two Nordic countries, which complete the puzzle of the five Nordic countries along with the
            Scandinavian countries, are not Scandinavian, but were colonized by and influenced by the Scandinavian
            countries. Finland and Iceland, the other two Nordic countries, were colonized and were part of Sweden and
            Denmark for much of their history.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Finland, which borders Sweden to the East, was part of Sweden until 1809 when it was taken by Russia, and it
            remained a part of Russia until 1917 when it gained independence from the newly formed Soviet Union. Because
            Finland was part of Sweden for so long, and it had a lot of cultural ties and influence from Sweden,
            Finland earned a spot as a Nordic country.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Iceland is an Island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It was a colony of Denmark for many centuries, with
            influence going back to the Viking Age. Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1944 after being occupied
            by the United States when Denmark was invaded and conquered by Germany in World War II.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The other two Nordic countries have these differences with the Scandinavian countries: they were not
            home of the Vikings/Norsemen, they have theyre own distinct languages and cultures with Scandinavian
            influence, they are not on The Scandinavian Peninusla or Denmark, and they are run by Republics instead of
            Constitutional Monarchies.</p>
        </br>
        <p>There are also a few other areas of the Nordic countries that are semi-independent but under the authority of
            Denmark or Norway.</p>
        </br>
        <p>One example is a places that is known as Greenland, and it is the world's largest island. It is in North
            America,
            seperated from Canada by seas to the West, and west of Iceland by a number of miles of ocean.
            Greenland is a huge (Over 800,000 square miles) but very sparsley populated place, with less
            than sixty-thousand residents. Like Iceland, it was colonized by Vikings, but it never gained independence
            from Denmark, and it is still controlled by Denmark to this day. Also, like Iceland, Greenland was occupied
            by the United States during World War II, but it was returned to Denmark after the war, whereas Iceland
            gained independence.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>The other two places that are part of the Nordic countries are Svalbard and Jan Mayen.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Svalbard is an island area way up above the Arctic circle, further North than Iceland and the populated areas
            of Greenland. It is controlled by Norway and is the Northernmost
            inhabited place on earth, with a very small and very sparse population of about two-and-a-half-thousand
            residents.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Jan Mayen is another Island that is controlled by Norway. However, it is not populated, and is really just a
            small island with geographic monuement that people can go visit, but cannot live on.</p>
