        <h2>Chapter One: Understanding Nordic and Scandinavian</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the Nordic Countries, there are two entities; The Scandinavian Countries, and the Other Nordic Countries.
            All of the Nordic Countries together are Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>All five countries are Nordic, but three of them are Scandinavian while the other two aren't; The
            Scandinavian countries are Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, and the other Nordic countries are Finland and
            Iceland. In order to undertstand which Nordic countries are Scandinavian and which ones are not, we need to
            look at their history and georgraphy.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The term "Nordic" basically means countries that were colonoized, controlled by, or influenced by the
            Scandinavian countries. </p>

        <h3>Map of Nordic Countries; The countries colored in red are the Scandinavian Countries, while the countries
            shaded in orange are the other Nordic Countries (All countries are the Nordic Countries)</h3>

    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The countries that are Scandinavian have the following traits; they are located along the Scandinavian
            Peninsula and Denmark, their languages are descended from Old Norse and Germanic languages, the ancient
            societies of
            Vikings came from their lands, and the were responsible for colonization and influence of the other two
            Nordic Countries.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The Scandinavian countries are as followed: </p>
        </br>
        <p>Sweden is the largest country by population and land area, and It
            takes up the eastern half of the Scandinavian Peninsula.</p></br>
        <p> Denmark is the smallest in land area but second in populaton, and it takes up the lands of Jutland and
            neighboring islands, all south of the main Scandinavian Peninsula (even though Denmark is not on the
            Scandinavian Peninsula and it is attacked to
            mainlaind Europe via Jutland, it is still Scandinavian as the Vikings and Norse cultures came from there).
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>Norway is the second largest in land area but smallest in population. It takes up the western half pf the
            Scandinavian Peninsula.</p>
        </br>
        <p>All three countries have history spanning back to the Viking Age, when their people, called Vikings (also
            know as Norsemen) led
            expeditions of war, raids, trade, and exchange to other places in Europe and other continents.</p>
        </br>
        <p>The three countries have a long history of conflict, exchange, and infleunce.</p>
